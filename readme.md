# The Colorful Collection

This is a website which collects images from the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh's varied collections across 3 of its museums.  Its purpose is to be a proof of concept for linking the three collections systems together that is interesting (at least to me).

### Current Status

Not yet released - There is not currently any timespan for this project to be complete and any current code in this repo will most likely not run (or run incorrectly)
